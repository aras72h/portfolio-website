# Portfolio Website
Always wanted to have a website to put my projects in it.

I signed up for an event called LevelUp in quera, which is an educational website.

The main goal of this event was to code up a portfolio website with HTML & CSS.

It was cheap and short, only weekends for 3 weeks. 

So, I said to myself that I can finally put the time in and build a personal website.

Little did I know that this course is gooing to be horrible.

They wanted us to build [this](https://websitedemos.net/personal-portfolio-02/?customize=template) website

So, I'm gonna ignore unqualified instractors and do it myself.

## Codespaces
I learned how to use Codespaces from Github, which is a great and **easy-to-use** technology.

Created a repository and started it in a new codespace.
Then opened the codespace in my local vscode.

It's kind of wild!

## Readme.md
Always start a new project with a document that is written in a human language.

This file is named README.md by convention.

md file extension (also written as .markdown) stands for **“Markdown documentation”**.

Use a .md cheatsheat to style the document.

#### Documentation
[Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Commit Changes
The git repository is already initialized.

The awsome part is pushing. It already knows where to push because we are in a codespace.

Use the commands bellow to commit:
```
git add README.md

git commit -m "edited README.md"

git push
```

## Boilerplate index.html
```
mkdir src
cd src
code index.html
```

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Portfolio</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
</head>

<body>
    <h1 class="text-9xl font-bold underline">
        hello, world
    </h1>
</body>

</html>
```

## Design
You can't start to code unless you have a design in hand.

We have a template here, but it doesn't match our specific needs.

We're going to design our layout in Figma.
